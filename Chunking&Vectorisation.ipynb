      "ent decisions, the European Commission takes legal action against Member States that fail to comply with their obligations under EU law. These decisions, covering various EU policy areas, aim to ensure the proper application of EU law for the benefit of citizens and businesses. The key decisions taken by the Commission are presented below and grouped by policy area. The Commission is also closing 112 cases where the issues with the Member States concerned have been solved. In these cases, the Commission does not have to pursue the infringement procedure further. The Commission's enforcement activities and Member States' compliance with EU law can be followed throughinteractive maps and customisable graphs. For more details on the history of a case or to access the full database of infringement decisions, theinfringement decisions' registeris open for consultation. And more information on the EU infringement procedure can be found in the followingQ&A. (For more information: Maciej Berestecki – Tel.:+32 2 296 64 83; Maëlys Dreux – Tel.: +32 229 54673) Letters of formal notice Commission calls on BULGARIA, GREECE, SPAIN, the NETHERLANDS and PORTUGAL to correctly transpose the Drinking Water DirectiveThe European Commission decided to open infringement procedures by sending letters of formal notice toBulgaria(INFR(2025)2030),Greece(INFR(2025)2049),Spain(INFR(2025)2026), theNetherlands(INFR(2025)2048) andPortugal(INFR(2025)2068) for failing to correctly transpose the recast Drinking Water Directive (Directive (EU) 2020/2184), which contributes to improving water resilience across the EU and achieving theEU's zero pollution ambition. The recast Drinking Water Directive further protects human health by updating water quality standards, tackling pollutants of concern, such as endocrine disruptors and microplastics, and providing cleaner tap water. The Directive also tackles water leakages when now, on average,30%of thedrinkingwater is lost during distribution in the EU. Member States were required to transpose the Directive into national law and comply with its provisions by 12 January 2023. In Bulgaria, national law does not correctly reflect the scope of exemptions and derogations provided in the Directive, the risk assessment and risk management required for the drinking water supply system, and aspects regarding the monitoring of the quality of drinking water. Concerning Greece, national law reduces the scope of application of the Directive and does not include all drinking water suppliers. For Spain, shortcomings include reducing the scope of application of the Directive, the lack of specific provisions on risk assessments regarding the drinking water supply system, and no provisions for a periodic review. The Dutch legislation has shortcomings as regards monitoring the quality of drinking water and promoting access to drinking water. The Portuguese legislation fails to correctly transpose several provisions of the Directive. This includes those related to the scope of application, the extent of the risk assessment regarding the drinking water supply system, the role of the competent authorities, and the products allowed to be in contact with drinking water. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of satisfactory responses, the Commission may decide to issue reasoned opinions. Commission calls on LITHUANIA to ensure periodic review of water permitsThe Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toLithuania(INFR(2025)2028) for failing to correctly transpose the Water Framework Directive(Directive 2000/60/EC), including the obligation to carry out periodic reviews of water permits. Full implementation of EU water quality standards is key to protecting human health and the environment. The Directive requires Member States to establish a programme of measures for each river basin district to ensure good status of European water bodies, such as rivers and lakes. Each programme must include measures to control different types of water abstraction, impoundment, point source discharge, diffuse pollution sources, etcetera. Member States are required to periodically review and update these control measures, including any permits granted, to determine whether they still achieve their objectives. However, in Lithuania, the obligation to periodically review water abstractions is incorrectly transposed both for surface water and groundwater. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Lithuania, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on GERMANY to correctly transpose the Waste Framework DirectiveThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toGermany(INFR(2025)2047) for failing to correctly transpose the Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/ECas amended byDirective 2018/851/EU). The amended Directive sets legally binding targets for preparing for re-use and recycling of certain waste streams, including municipal waste. It also requires Member States to improve their waste management systems and resource efficiency. Member States were required to transpose the amended Directive into national law by 5 July 2020. The Commission has found that Germany has not correctly transposed the requirements for Extended Producer Responsibility Schemes (in terms of geographical coverage and adequate self-control and monitoring mechanisms), the duty to collect waste separately and separate unlawfully mixed waste, the rules on selective demolition, and rules on the use of materials produced from bio-waste. Germany also failed to encourage home composting. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Germany, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on SPAIN to correctly transpose the Seveso III DirectiveThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toSpain(INFR(2025)2029) for failing to correctly transpose the Seveso III Directive (Directive 2012/18/EU) on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances. The Directive applies to over 12,000 industrial installations across the EU and provides the relevant framework on risk management measures to prevent major accidents and to limit their consequences. It plays a key role in steering the EU towards zero pollution from industrial accidents, a commitment set out in theZero Pollution Action Plan. The Commission found that Spain has not correctly transposed several provisions of the Seveso III Directive. This includes provisions on reporting obligations; time limits to draw up emergency plans for new establishments; and the need to clean up the environment following a major accident. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Spain, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on POLAND to bring its national legislation in line with the Single Use Plastic DirectiveThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toPoland(INFR(2025)2046) for failing to correctly transpose the provisions of the Single-Use Plastics Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/904). The Directive aims to prevent and reduce the impact of certain plastic products on the environment and on human health, as well as to promote the transition to acircular economy. In Polish legislation, the definition of the ‘producer' does not cover all activities carried out by entities producing and introducing single-use plastic products on the market. Therefore, the scope of the application of the rules on single-use plastic is limited. Polish legislation also does not guarantee that all waste management costs of the single-use plastic products under the Extended Producer Responsibility schemes are properly calculated and borne by waste producers. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Poland, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Additional letter of formal notice under Article 258 TFUE Commission calls on SLOVAKIA to bring national laws in line with the Environmental Impact Assessment DirectiveThe European Commission decided to send an additional letter of formal notice toSlovakia(INFR(2019)2223) for failing to bring national law in line with the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive (Directive 2011/92/EUas amended byDirective 2014/52/EU). The Directive requires major building or development projects in the EU to be assessed for their impact on the environment before the project can start. Slovakia has not correctly transposed all the requirements of the EIA Directive into national law. The shortcomings are related mainly to the timeliness of the decisions, to possible conflicts of interest, as well as to the lack of effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. In October 2019, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Slovakia, which agreed to address the identified shortcomings. Since then, the amendment to the Slovak EIA Act entered into force on 1 January 2025, followed by the entry into force of the new Slovak Construction Act on 15 March 2025. However, despite these efforts to address the shortcomings, the current legislative framework in Slovakia still does not fully comply with the EIA Directive, especially regarding access to justice. The Commission is therefore sending an additional letter of formal notice to Slovakia, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Reasoned opinions Commission calls on BULGARIA, GREECE, HUNGARY, and SLOVAKIA to comply with the reporting obligations under the Noise DirectiveToday, the European Commission decided to send reasoned opinions toBulgaria(INFR(2024)2203),Greece(INFR(2024)2198),Hungary(INFR(2024)2199) andSlovakia(INFR(2024)2202) for failing to comply with the Noise Directive (Directive 2002/49/EC). The Noise Directive identifies noise pollution levels and triggers the necessary action as a response, such as appropriate urban planning and noise protection measures. The Directive requires Member States to adopt maps showing noise exposure within major agglomerations, along main railway lines, main roads and around major airports. These strategic noise maps serve as a basis for defining measures to help reduce noise pollution in the noise action plans. Member States are also required to inform the Commission of the findings of the strategic noise maps so that it can draw up a report covering the situation of noise exposure in the EU. The Commission sent letters of formal notice to these four Member States in October 2024. Since then, these four Member States have failed to report all relevant information on the strategic noise maps, including noise exposure of the population to the Commission. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary and Slovakia, which now have two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Commission calls on ITALY to prevent and manage the spread of invasive alien speciesToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toItaly(INFR(2024)2226) for failing to prevent and manage the introduction and spread of the fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), as required by the Invasive Alien Species Regulation (IASRegulation (EU) 1143/2014). Invasive alien species are one of the five major causes of biodiversity loss in Europe and worldwide. The IAS Regulation aims to prevent, minimise and mitigate the adverse effects of invasive alien species on biodiversity and related ecosystems, as well as on human health and safety, and to reduce their social and economic impact in Europe. Contrary to the Regulation, after the documentation of the fire ant in Sicily, Italy did not notify without delay the Commission and the other Member States of its early detection. The Italian authorities also did not notify the Commission of the eradication measures taken within three months of the early detection notification. The Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Italy in November 2024. It appears that no eradication measure was taken for a long time after the detection of the fire ant and that Italy did not take all the necessary measures to prevent the unintentional spread of the fire ant. Italy has also not effectively implemented the surveillance system of invasive alien species of Union concern. Moreover, Italy has not addressed several arguments raised in the letter of formal notice. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Italy, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Commission calls on ROMANIA to take the necessary steps to protect and manage its Natura 2000 sitesToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toRomania(INFR(2020)2238) for failing to comply with the Habitats Directive (Directive 92/43/EEC). Under the Habitats Directive, Member States must propose sites of Community importance, which will become part of the EU-wideNatura 2000network. After a site has been endorsed by the Commission, the Member State has six years to designate it as a Special Area of Conservation and to establish conservation objectives and measures that will maintain or restore the protected species and habitats to a favourable conservation status. These are key requirements to manage the Natura 2000 network and to protect biodiversity across the EU. On 2 July 2020, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Romania for failing to designate 382 sites of Community importance as Special Areas of Conservation. The Commission also found that Romania failed to set site-specific detailed conservation objectives for these sites. Since then, Romania has designated 213 Special Areas of Conservation, while 169 sites remain undesignated. Additionally, 16 sites do not have site-specific conservation objectives, and 208 sites have incomplete site-specific conservation objectives. Also, the conservation measures for 10 sites are too general to ensure an adequate protection of the habitats and species for which these have been designated. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Romania, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Commission calls on SLOVAKIA to improve its treatment of wasteToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toSlovakia(INFR(2021)2168) for failing to correctly apply the Landfill Directive (Directive 1999/31/EC) and the Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/ECas amended byDirective(EU)2018/851). The Landfill Directive sets standards for landfills to prevent adverse effects on human health, water, soil and air. Under this Directive, Member States must take measures to ensure that only waste that has been subject to treatment is landfilled. Under the Waste Framework Directive, Member States must recover and dispose of waste in a manner that does not endanger human health and the environment. It prohibits the abandonment, dumping or uncontrolled disposal of waste. In November 2021, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Slovakia. However, the identified shortcomings have not yet been remedied. Firstly, Slovakia still has not transposed correctly into its national legislation the obligation to pre-treat waste before landfilling, and repeatedly postponed the entry into force of this obligation – currently until 1 January 2027. In addition, Slovakia has not yet taken all the planned measures to support separate collection, such as increase of landfilling fees and an introduction of the ‘pay as you throw' principle. Despite improvement, the level of separate collection of municipal waste is thus still low in Slovakia. Furthermore, the capacity of installations for treatment of waste before landfilling is still insufficient. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Slovakia, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Referrals to the Court of Justice Commission decides to refer POLAND to the Court of Justice of the European Union for not transposing the Drinking Water DirectiveToday, the European Commission decided to referPoland(INFR(2023)0089)to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to adopt national laws transposing the recast Drinking Water Directive (Directive (EU) 2020/2184). The recast Drinking Water Directive further protects human health by updating water quality standards, tackling pollutants of concern, such as endocrine disruptors and microplastics, and providing cleaner tap water. The recast Directive also tackles water leakages when now, on average, 30% of the drinking water is lost during distribution in the EU. Member States were required to transpose the Directive into national law and comply with its provisions by 12 January 2023. The Commission considers that efforts by the Polish authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Poland to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial sanctions. More information is in thepress release. Commission decides to refer GREECE to the Court of Justice of the European Union for not adopting noise action plansToday, the European Commission decided to referGreece(INFR(2017)2150) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to adopt noise action plans for all agglomerations and major roads as required under the Noise Directive (Directive 2002/49/EC). The Noise Directive identifies noise pollution levels and triggers the necessary action as a response, such as appropriate urban planning and noise protection measures. The Directive requires Member States to adopt maps showing noise exposure within major agglomerations, along main railway lines, main roads and around major airports. These strategic noise maps serve as a basis for defining measures to help reduce noise pollution in the noise action plans. They are key for informing the public about the levels of noise they are exposed to, so that they can verify themselves whether their authorities take sufficient action. Noise maps had not been adopted for most agglomerations and those that were adopted did not meet the minimum requirements set by the Directive and the public had not been properly consulted. Greece had also failed to properly identify all roads for which strategic maps and action plans should have been prepared. Despite some progress, several grievances remained. The Commission considers that efforts by the Greek authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Greece to the Court of Justice of the European Union. More information is in thepress release. Commission decides to refer POLAND to the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning access to justice in environmental casesToday, the European Commission decided to referPoland(INFR(2020)2105) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to ensure that members of the public concerned, including individuals and environmental NGOs, can challenge the absence or insufficiency of air quality plans, required under the Ambient Air Quality Directive (Directive 2008/50/EC). When the limit values for air pollution set by EU law are exceeded, the Directive requires Member States to adopt air quality plans and set appropriate measures to keep exceedance periods as short as possible. In parallel, under the Aarhus Convention and the EU Treaties, individual citizens and environmental NGOs must be able to challenge authorities' decisions or lack thereof if they believe the action taken is insufficient. The Commission considers that the efforts made by the Polish authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Poland to the Court of Justice of the European Union. More information is in thepress release. Letter of formal notice post-judgment (Article 260 TFEU) Commission calls on GREECE to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice to protect natural habitats and speciesThe European Commission decided to send a letter of formal notice under Article 260 TFEU toGreece(INFR(2014)2260) for failing to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 17 December 2020 (C‑849/19). The ruling found that Greece has not established conservation objectives and measures for 239 Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) as required by the Habitats Directive (Directive 92/43/EEC). Under the Habitats Directive, Member States must propose sites of Community importance (SCIs), which will become part of the EU-wideNatura 2000network. After a site has been endorsed by the Commission, the Member State has six years to designate it as a SAC and to establish conservation objectives and measures that will maintain or restore the protected species and habitats to a favourable conservation status. These are key requirements to manage the Natura 2000 network and to protect biodiversity across the EU. While Greece has designated 239 SACs and made progress in establishing conservation objectives since the Court ruling, it still has failed to establish the necessary conservation measures for all 239 SACs. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Greece, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to refer Greece to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial sanctions. (For more information: Maciej Berestecki - Tel.:+32 2 296 64 83, Anna Wartberger – Tel.: +32 2 298 20 54) Letter of formal notice Commission calls on PORTUGAL to effectively enforce rules against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishingThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toPortugal(INFR(2025)2072) for failing to properly enforce the EU's rules against illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. In its letter of formal notice, the Commission refers to structural shortcomings in Portugal's application of the EU Catch Certification Scheme (Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008), which is designed to prevent IUU-caught fish from entering the EU market. Despite the EU's zero-tolerance policy towards IUU fishing, which harms fish stocks, marine habitats, and coastal communities, Portugal has consistently failed to verify the origin of fishery products from third countries, allowing large quantities of high-value IUU-caught fish to enter the EU. Therefore, the Commission is sending a letter of formal notice to Portugal, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. (For more information: Lea Zuber – Tel.: +32 2 295 62 98; Federica Miccoli – Tel.: +32 229-58300) Letters of formal notice Commission calls on HUNGARY to comply with rules on freedom of establishmentThe European Commission has decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toHungary(INFR(2025)2051) for failing to award a high-value exploitation contract for sand and gravel mining sites in an open and transparent tender procedure. The freedom of establishment enshrined inArticle 49 TFEUrequires that public authorities ensure the equal treatment of economic operators and the transparency of award procedures. The Commission considers that Hungary failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 49 TFEU by awarding the exploitation contract in a closed tender procedure. The lack of transparency of this procedure precluded interested economic operators from participating in it. The contract has been awarded for a period of 20 years and extendable to 30 years, during which a continuous violation of the rights of other interested operators excluded from the award process is occurring. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Hungary, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on SLOVENIA to comply with public procurement rulesThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toSlovenia(INFR(2025)4011) for failing to comply with European public procurement rules.Directive 2014/24/EUon public procurement establishes the procedures for award of public contracts by Member States' authorities. The Directive provides for a few exceptions where national authorities are not required to follow these procedures.An amendment of the Slovenian Pharmacy Act exempts public pharmacy institutes from carrying out public procurement procedures for the purchase of medicines. The Commission considers that this exemption contravenes the obligations of the Directive. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Slovenia, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on HUNGARY to ensure equal treatment of economic operators for food and non-food productsThe European Commission decided to open infringement procedures by sending two letters of formal notice toHungary(INFR(2025)2052 and INFR(2025)2102) for imposing price margin restrictions on non-Hungarian companies. The first procedure concerns restrictions on the sale of certain food products by food retailers. The second procedure covers similar restrictions for the sale of certain non-food products by drugstores. The freedom of establishment pursuant toArticle 49 TFEUrequires public authorities to ensure the equal treatment and non-discrimination of economic operators and to refrain from restricting economic activities unless such restrictions are justified to attain certain public interest considerations. Hungary limits the margin between purchase prices and sales prices of certain products to a level that no longer covers the costs of foreign companies beyond their costs for purchasing products, forcing non-Hungarian retailers to sell their products at a loss. The Commission is therefore sending two letters of formal notice to Hungary, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue reasoned opinions. Reasoned opinions Commission asks FRANCE to comply with EU rules on freedom of movement for veterinary companies and veterinariansToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toFrance(INFR(2024)4005) regarding its national rules concerning veterinary companies and veterinarians. According to the Commission, French rules fail to comply with theServices Directive 2006/123/ECand with Articles 49 and 56 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, which ensure that service providers do not face unjustified barriers when establishing themselves in a Member State or providing services cross-border. The French rules require that a majority of shareholders in a veterinary company be exercising veterinarians within the company in question. The French rules also require veterinarians to be present in each of their establishments at least part-time. This limits the number of veterinary companies a veterinarian can work in. In addition, while French law allows, in principle, for the free provision of services, the practice restricts veterinarians established in other Member States from offering their services on a temporary and occasional basis in France. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to France, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Referrals to the Court of Justice Commission refers GERMANY to the Court of Justice of the European Union for incorrect transposition of the EU public procurement directivesToday, the European Commission has decided to referGermany(INFR(2018)2272) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for incorrect transposition of the EU public procurement Directives (Directive 2014/24/EUandDirective 2014/23/EU). The EU public procurement Directives contain provisions on postal services which have not been transposed into German law. In particular, German law does not require contracting entities to apply public procurement rules in this sector. First, the Commission considers that German law does not require from contracting authorities that they provide detailed information to tenderers after the conclusion of the contract to trigger the start of the shortened period for access to review. This makes it difficult for bidders to decide whether and by when to launch a review. Secondly, the definition of ‘contracting entity' in German law lacks clarity, complicating the selection of the appropriate tendering procedures. Thirdly, German law does not require contracting entities in the postal sector to apply public procurement rules. Despite some of the identified grievances having been resolved, the Commission considers that efforts by the authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Germany to the Court of Justice of the European Union. More information is in thepress release. Letter of formal notice post-judgment (Article 260 TFEU) Commission calls on PORTUGAL and SLOVAKIA to comply with the Late Payment DirectiveThe European Commission has decided to send two letters of formal notice under Article 260 TFEU toPortugalandSlovakia(INFR(2017)2037 and INFR(2016)4131) for failing to comply with their obligations under the Late Payment Directive (Directive 2011/7/EC), as confirmed by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Late payments negatively impact businesses by reducing liquidity, hindering growth, and weakening resilience. They also limit a business's ability to transition to greener practices and embrace digital transformation. Businesses and especially SMEs rely on regular payments to operate and pay their employees. The Late Payment Directive obliges public authorities to pay their invoices within 30 days (60 days for authorities providing healthcare). The Court of Justice found that Portugal and Slovakia have failed to fulfil their obligations under the Late Payments Directive (Commission v Portugal, 11 July 2024 and Commission v Slovakia, 19 September 2024). The measures announced by Portugal and Slovakia since the rulings have not delivered sufficient improvements in addressing the issue. Portugal and Slovakia now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may refer the cases back to the Court of Justice, with a request to impose financial sanctions.

Finland has also failed to correctly transpose certain provisions ofCommission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/68on marking and ofCommission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/69on alarm and signal weapons. The Firearms Directive sets common minimum standards on the acquisition, possession, and commercial exchange of civilian firearms, for example firearms used for sport shooting and hunting. The rules under the Directive allow for the lawful use and movement of firearms, essential components and ammunition for civilian use within the EU. At the same time, the Directive keeps high standards of security and protection against criminal acts and illicit trafficking of firearms.Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/68sets rules on the marking of firearms to increase the traceability of firearms and facilitate the safe transfer of firearms and essential components.Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/69sets technical specifications for alarm and signal weapons (which only discharge blank ammunition or irritants) to avoid that they are illegally converted into lethal firearms. The Commission is sending a letter of formal notice to Finland and Italy, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue reasoned opinions. Commission calls on IRELAND to fulfil the obligations on the marketing and use of explosives precursorsThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toIreland(INFR(2025)2053) for failing to comply with certain obligations under the Regulation on the marketing and use of explosives precursors (Regulation (EU) 2019/1148). The Regulation establishes EU-wide rules regarding substances and mixtures that could be misused to make homemade explosives. It limits the availability of those substances or mixtures to the general public and requires any suspicious transactions involving the substances to be reported to the appropriate authorities. The Commission considers that Ireland failed to comply with a number of obligations under the Regulation, such as the obligations to lay down rules on penalties, designate the competent authority for the implementation of the Regulation or notify measures for the licencing regime. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Ireland, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Reasoned opinions Commission calls on LUXEMBOURG, HUNGARY and SLOVAKIA to correctly transpose the provisions of the Child Sexual Abuse DirectiveToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toLuxembourg(INFR(2019)2236),Hungary(INFR(2019)2234) andSlovakia(INFR(2019)2135) for failure to correctly transpose into national law the Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography (Directive 2011/93/EU).The EU has strict rules criminalising child sexual abuse, child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse material across Europe. The Directive includes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions andintroduces provisions to strengthen the prevention of those crimes and the protection of child victims. The Directive also requires Member States to ensure that effective intervention programmes or measures are made available to offenders. The three Member States have not correctly transposed a number of these rules. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to these Member States, which now have two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Referrals to the Court of Justice Commission refers BULGARIA, IRELAND and PORTUGAL to the Court of Justice of the European Union for not complying with the Terrorist Content Online RegulationToday, the Commission decided to referBulgaria(INFR(2022)2113),Ireland(INFR(2022)2121) andPortugal(INFR(2022)2129)to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to comply with certain obligations from the Regulation on the dissemination of terrorist content online (“TCO Regulation” -Regulation (EU) 2021/784). The TCO Regulation, which became applicable on 7 June 2022, requires that terrorist content in the EU is taken down by online platforms within one hour upon receipt of a removal order issued by Member States' authorities. This helps to counter the spread of extremist ideologies online – which is key for preventing attacks and addressing radicalisation – while safeguarding fundamental rights. The Commission considers that Bulgaria, Ireland and Portugal have failed to comply with one or more obligations under the TCO Regulation. This includes the requirement to designate the authority or authorities responsible for enforcing the Regulation and ensuring compliance, and to notify the Commission of those authorities; to establish a public contact point to handle requests for clarification and feedback in relation to removal orders; and to lay down the rules and measures on penalties in case of non-compliance of hosting service providers with their legal obligations. The Commission is therefore referring Bulgaria, Ireland and Portugal to the Court of Justice of the European Union. More information is available in thepress release. (For more information:Markus Lammert – Tel.: +32 2 296 75 33; Yuliya Matsyk - Tel.: +32 2 226 27 16) Letters of formal notice The Commission calls on ITALY and LITHUANIA to correctly transpose the EU rules on the presumption of innocence and the right to be present at trial in criminal proceedingsThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toItaly(INFR(2025)2066) andLithuania(INFR(2025)2067), for failing to correctly transpose the Directive on the strengthening of the presumption of innocence and the right to be present at the trial in criminal proceedings (Directive 2016/343/EU). The Directive is one ofsix Directivesadopted by the EU to create common minimum standards ensuring that fair trialrights of suspects and accused personsin criminal proceedings are sufficiently protected across the EU. The Commission considers that certain national transposition measures notified by the two Member States fall short of the requirements of the Directive. In particular, the Commission found that Italy failed to correctly transpose the provisions on the limitations to the use of measures of physical restraint in public, the right to silence and not to incriminate oneself, whenever investigating authorities gather information at the scene or immediately after the offence and whenever the suspect gives spontaneous statements. Lithuania failed to transpose the measures related to public references to guilt, the use of measures of physical restraint in court, the temporary nature of the exclusion from the trial, and the right to a new trial. Moreover, both Member States have failed to correctly transpose the requirement to have the person triedin absentiainformed of their right to a new trial, as well as remedies available in case of breaches of the rights enshrined in the Directive. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Italy and Lithuania, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on MALTA to comply with EU rules on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial mattersThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toMalta(INFR(2025)2100), for failing to comply with its obligations under the Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments(Regulation (EU) 1215/2012)in the area of gambling. The Commission found that Malta failed to comply with the Regulation by imposing on its courts an obligation to systematically refuse —on grounds of national public policy— the recognition and enforcement of judgments issued by courts of other EU Member States against Maltese-licensed gaming companies. Additionally, Malta discourages foreign litigants from pursuing legal action in Maltese courts against these entities, despite EU rules designating such courts as the appropriate forum based on the defendant's domicile. The Commission considers that the Maltese legislation, by effectively shielding the online gaming sector from cross-border litigation, undermines the principle of mutual trust in the administration of justice within the Union. It also violates the prohibition on reviewing judgments from other Member States on their substance, exceeds the limits of the public policy exception, and distorts the EU's rules on jurisdiction. Therefore, the Commission is sending a letter of formal notice to Malta, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Reasoned opinions Commission calls on the NETHERLANDS to fully transpose the Directive on procedural safeguards for children in criminal proceedingsThe European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion totheNetherlands(INFR(2023)2089) for failing to fully transpose the Directive on procedural safeguards for children in criminal proceedings (Directive (EU) 2016/800) into national law. This Directive aims to guarantee common minimum standards regarding the rights of children who aresuspects or accused personsin criminal proceedings to ensure their right to a fair trial across the EU. The Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the Netherlands in October 2023. After analysing their reply, the Commission concluded that the Netherlands still failed to correctly transpose the provisions related to the right of the child to receive information on the requirement for the holder(s) of parental responsibility to be informed of the child's rights. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to the Netherlands, which now have two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Commission calls on GERMANY, LUXEMBOURG, and POLAND to transpose EU rules on the EU Emergency Travel DocumentToday, the European Commission decided to send reasoned opinions toGermany(INFR(2025)0028 and INFR(2025)0032),Luxembourg(INFR(2025)0067 and INFR(2025)0071) andPoland(INFR(2025)0084 and INFR(2025)0089) for failing to transposeCouncil Directive (EU) 2019/997establishing a uniform EU Emergency Travel Document (‘EU ETD') and the accompanyingCommission Delegated Directive (EU) 2024/1986. The EU ETD Directive provides that Member States issue EU Emergency Travel Documents to EU citizens whose passports have been lost, stolen, or destroyed when being abroad, to allow them to return to their countries of origin or residence. Member States had until 9 December 2024 to transpose both Directives into national law and must start issuing the new EU Emergency Travel Document on 9 December 2025. The Commission sent letters of formal notice to Germany, Luxembourg and Poland on 31 January 2025 for failing to communicate transposition measures. Since these Member States did not take the necessary measures to ensure the transposition of the two Directives, the Commission has decided to issue reasoned opinions to Germany, Luxembourg, and Poland. The three Member States now have two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Referrals to the Court of Justice Commission decides to refer POLAND and SWEDEN to the Court of Justice of the European Union for incorrectly transposing rules on the European arrest warrantToday, the European Commission decided to referPoland(INFR(2020)2308) andSweden(INFR(2020)2362) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to comply with the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA). The Commission sent a first letter of formal notice to Sweden in February 2021 and an additional letter of formal notice in February 2024 for failing to correctly transpose the provisions of the Framework Decision. However, the Commission still considered that the transposition by Sweden was not correct and therefore sent a reasoned opinion in October 2024. The Commission sent a first letter of formal notice to Poland in December 2020. After assessing the reply, the Commission considered that some of the grievances persisted and, therefore, sent an additional letter of formal notice to Poland in July 2023 and a reasoned opinion in April 2024. The Commission considers that efforts by the authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is thus referring Poland and Sweden to the Court of Justice of the European Union. More information is available in thepress release. (For more information: Anna-Kaisa Itkonen – Tel.: +32 2 295 75 01; Giulia Bedini – Tel.: +32 2 295 86 61; Ana Crespo Parrondo – Tel.: +32 2 298 13 25) Letters of formal notice Commission calls PORTUGAL and ROMANIA to comply with the EU rules on ecodesign and energy labelling of productsToday, the European Commission decided to send letters of formal notice toPortugal(INFR(2025)2073) andRomania(INFR(2025)2074) for not ensuring effective compliance with the EU regulations on ecodesign (Directive 2009/125/EC) and energy labelling (Regulation (EU) 2017/1369) of products. Member States are responsible for ensuring effective surveillance of their markets and that only products complying with all the applicable EU rules are placed on the market. In practical terms, this means checking products satisfy the minimum energy use requirements and have a correct energy label providing consumers with the information they need for purchase decisions. The Market Surveillance Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2019/1020) sets out the obligation of the Member States to ensure effective market surveillance, which include having a national market surveillance authority, resourcing it adequately and giving it power to investigate, performing checks on products at an adequate scale and reporting those checks in the Information and Communication System for Market Surveillance database. The Commission considers that the two Member States do not comply with this obligation and is therefore sending letters of formal notice to Portugal and Romania, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on HUNGARY to abolish charges imposed on operators receiving free allowances under the EU Emissions Trading SystemToday, the European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toHungary(INFR(2025)4016), for applying a carbon quota tax and a transaction fee to recipients of a significant free allocation of allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS,Directive 2003/87/EC), as those charges interfere with the EU law. The ETS Directive andCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331lay down harmonised rules on the free allocation of allowances to industrial installations participating in the EU ETS. Free allocation refers to the distribution of emissions allowances at no cost to certain installations, to help prevent “carbon-leakage”, meaning the relocation of industries outside the EU to countries with less stringent climate policies. These free allowances must be granted without charges or conditions that would undermine their intended economic benefit. Furthermore, the EU ETS Registry Regulation (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/1122) requires any fees charged by national competent authorities on holders of the accounts in theUnion Registryto be reasonable. By contrast, Hungarian legislation provides for charges which apply to recipients of significant free allocation, and they are qualified as such according to the amount of annual emissions and of received free allocation. The first charge is the carbon quota tax, equivalent to €36 per tonne of CO2yearly emissions of the installation. The second charge is a transaction fee, payable to the competent authority after a transfer of allowances under the EU ETS, whether allocated for free or purchased. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Hungary, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Reasoned opinions Commission urges GREECE and FINLAND to fully transpose EU rules accelerating permitting procedures for renewable energy projectsToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toGreece(INFR(2024)0221) andFinland(INFR(2024)0226) for failing to fully transpose into national law the provisions of the revised Renewable Energy Directive related to the simplification and acceleration of permitting procedures. The revised Directive (Directive (EU) 2023/2413, amendingDirective (EU) 2018/2001entered into force in November 2023 and certain provisions had to be transposed into national law by 1 July 2024. These provisions include measures to simplify and accelerate permitting procedures both for renewable energy projects and for the infrastructure projects which are necessary to integrate the additional capacity into the electricity system. They also include clear time limits for permit-granting procedures targeted to specific technologies or types of projects, the strengthening of the role of the single contact point for applications and the presumption that renewable energy projects and the related grid infrastructure are of overriding public interest. In September 2024, the Commission sent letters of formal notice to 26 Member States for failing to fully transpose the Directive into national law. After having examined the transposition measures notified by Greece and Finland, the Commission has concluded that neither of the two Member States have yet fully transposed the provisions related to the simplification and acceleration of permitting procedures. The Commission is therefore sending a reasoned opinion to both Member States, which now have two months to respond and take the necessary measures to complete the transposition. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union. (For more information:Anna-Kaisa Itkonen – Tel.: +32 2 295 75 01;Saul Louis Goulding – Tel.: +32 229-64735) Letters of formal notice Commission calls on BELGIUM and PORTUGAL to deploy customs electronic systemsThe European Commission decided to open infringement procedures by sending letters of formal notice to Portugal (INFR(2025 2064) andBelgium(INFR(2025)2016) for failing to deploy the system for Temporary Storage for air transport and – in the case ofPortugal(INFR(2025) 2064) - in addition for also failing to deploy the National Import System . The Member States were obliged to build and make these systems operational, including by ensuring full migration of the relevant economic operators' systems, by 31 December 2023 according to the Union Customs Code (Regulation (EU) 952/2013) and the UCC Work Programme (Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2023/2879). The electronic system for temporary storage allows the relevant declarations to be lodged electronically and is one of the crucial steps to ensure the supervision of goods entering the EU. Once these declarations are launched electronically, the National Import System ensures that relevant measures of both a fiscal and non-fiscal nature are applied to goods imported into the EU. By providing interconnections with various other national applications, the National Import System plays a central role in ensuring, among others, the effective collection of revenues and the protection of the EU's financial interests, as well as the enforcement of EU level and national prohibitions/restrictions in connection with the import of goods. The Commission is therefore sending letters of formal notice to Belgium and Portugal, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion Commission calls on BELGIUM to comply with EU customs data transmission requirementsThe European Commission decided to open infringement procedures by sending letter of formal notice to Belgium (INFR(2025)2009) for failing to meet their obligations on customs data transmission. Under the Union Customs Code (UCC) (Regulation (EU) 952/2013) and theCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447, the Member States are required to transmit specific customs data through SURV3, an EU-operated digital system accessible to national customs authorities. The SURV3 IT system ensures the collection and monitoring of customs data across the European Union, facilitating the uniform application of customs controls, effective risk management, and compliance with EU border measures. The UCC and the UCC-IA stipulate that Member States must transmit a set of 57 standardised data elements in a specified format to the SURV3 system. However, despite deadlines to comply, the targeted Member States continue to use outdated formats and provide reduced datasets. This non-compliance undermines the efficacy and reliability of EU customs operations and the regulatory frameworks that support them. The Commission is therefore sending letter of formal notice to Belgium, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings identified by the Commission. In the absence of satisfactory responses, the Commission may decide to issue reasoned opinions. Commission calls on SPAIN to end the discriminatory taxation of non-resident individuals' dwellings used as habitual residenceThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toSpain(INFR(2025)4007) for failing to align its rules on taxation of non-resident taxpayers on their dwellings used as habitual residence with the free movement of workers (Article 45 TFEUandArticle 28 EEA) and with the free movement of capital (Article 63 TFEUandArticle 40 EEA). While resident taxpayers are not subject to tax on deemed income attributable to their dwellings used as habitual residence, non-resident taxpayers are required to pay income tax on 2% of the cadastral value of their dwellings used as habitual residence as deemed income. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Spain, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings identified by the Commission. In the absence of satisfactory responses, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Reasoned opinion Commission calls on PORTUGAL to comply with the EU excise duty legislation on wineToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toPortugal(INFR(2020)4063) for failing to comply with EU excise duty rules on wine (Council Directive 92/83/EEC). EU excise duty legislation allows the application of a zero-excise duty on wine. Stronger wines (with an alcoholic strength between 15% and 18% by volume) may benefit from this treatment only if their strength has been obtained naturally. However, if the alcoholic strength of these products has been increased for example by the addition of sugar or alcohol, a higher excise duty rate must be charged. The Portuguese legislation does not include this condition. As a result, these products incorrectly benefit from the zero rate applicable in Portugal to wine. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Portugal, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Commission calls on HUNGARY to abolish its retail tax regime to comply with the freedom of establishmentThe European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toHungary(INFR(2024)4022) for failing to bring its retail tax regime in line with the freedom of establishment guaranteed byArticles 49and54of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Due to the current design of the retail tax regime, foreign controlled retail companies operating in Hungary as integrated companies or linked undertakings, are subject to high and steeply progressive tax rates on their turnover. Domestic retailers operating on the Hungarian market under their respective brands and logos via franchise systems are not subject to the same highest rates because their turnover is not consolidated for taxation purposes. Notably, the regime prevents the foreign controlled retail companies from restructuring their business operations like those domestic retail companies. Therefore, the retail tax regime constitutes a restriction to the freedom of establishment. According to the 2023 and 2024 Country Specific Recommendations (CSR) to Hungary, this tax disproportionally burdens larger foreign companies, similarly to other sector-specific taxes introduced in the recent years and affecting the internal market. As part of its Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP), which was endorsed by the Council on 15 December 2022, Hungary committed to phase out the retail tax, which had been introduced in 2022 to increase the contribution of the retail sector to public finances. However, Hungary has so far failed to phase out the surtax on the retail sector. On the contrary, Hungary has consistently prolonged this tax measure without indicating a clear timeline for expiry so far, and has, over time, increased the highest tax rates applicable under the retail tax regime. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Hungary, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Referrals to the Court of Justice Commission decides to refer PORTUGAL to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to notify measures in the area of excise dutyToday, the European Commission decided to referPortugal(INFR(2022)0160 and INFR(2022)0162)to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to fully transpose into national lawCouncil Directive (EU) 2020/262of 19 December 2019 laying down the general arrangements for excise duty (recast) andCouncil Directive (EU) 2020/1151of 29 July 2020 amendingDirective 92/83/EECon the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic beverages. Directive (EU) 2020/262 is of crucial importance in the area of excise duty by providing common rules on the movements of excise goods. The remaining transposition gap in Portugal affects for instance the validity of the guarantees submitted by excise operators. Such guarantees are needed to perform cross border movements of excise goods within the EU. Directive (EU) 2020/1151 sets up an EU-wide certification system for small alcohol producers to facilitate their access to lower excise duty rates across the Union. It also supports the fight against fraud by clarifying the conditions for the application of the exemptions for alcohol not intended for human consumption. The transposition gap by Portugal affects the cross-border trade of alcohol produced by small producers of wine to other Member States and of the alcohol not intended for human consumption. All EU Member States were required to bring into force the laws necessary to fully transpose Directive (EU) 2020/262 and Directive (EU) 2020/1151 by 31 December 2021 and communicate the text of those measures to the Commission immediately. However, the national measures fully transposing these Directives still have not been notified by Portugal. The Commission considers that efforts by the authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Portugal to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial sanctions. More information is in thepress release. (For more information:Anna-Kaisa Itkonen – Tel.: +32 2 295 75 01; Anna Wartberger – Tel.: +32 2 298 20 54) Reasoned opinion Commission calls on BELGIUM to fully transpose EU rules on tolls and user charges for road infrastructure useToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toBelgium(INFR(2024)0149) for failing to fully transpose EU rules on the charging of vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (Directive (EU) 2022/362). The Directive sets common rules on imposing distance-based charges (tolls) and time-based user charges (vignette/s), allowing Member States to recover infrastructure costs (construction, operation, maintenance) through tolls or vignettes. Belgium did not communicate its transposition measures within the prescribed deadline of 25 March 2024. Despite receiving a letter of formal notice on 23 May 2024, Belgium has only partially complied with the transposition requirements, notifying measures for the Flanders and Brussels Capital regions, but not for the Wallonia region. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion. Belgium now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. (For more information: Thomas Regnier - Tel.: +32 2 299 10 99,Patricia Poropat – Tel.:+32 2 298 04 85) Reasoned opinion Commission calls on ROMANIA to comply with rules on extended collective licensing of copyrightToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toRomania(INFR (2015)4027) for failing to comply with certain EU rules on copyright and related rights (Directive 2001/29/EC) andDirective (EU) 2019/790). The rules are related to the extended collective licensing system in place for the right of communication to the public of musical works. After sendinga first letter of formal noticecalling on Romania to bring its law in line with the EU copyright framework, Romania amended its legislation. The Commission found that the amendments did not fully address the infringement, and it sent Romania anadditional letter of formal notice. However, the Commission continues having concerns as regards the compatibility of the Romanian Copyright Act with EU Copyright law since the broad scope of the extended collective licensing system in Romanian law affects the exercise of the authors' exclusive right of communication to the public. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Romania, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

The Commission considers that French law does not ensure that workers, who fall ill during their annual leave, can take later their annual leave days that overlapped with their illness. The Commission considers that French law therefore does not comply with the Working Time Directive and does not ensure the health and safety of workers. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to France, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Referral to the Court of Justice Commission decides to refer SPAIN to the Court of Justice of the European Union for not fully transposing the rules on transparent and predictable working conditions into national lawToday, the European Commission decided to referSpain(INFR(2022)0354) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to fully transpose the Directive on transparent and predictable working conditions (Directive 2019/1152) into national law. EU rules require, for instance, that workers receive timely and complete information about essential aspects of their job, such as working time and remuneration. According to the measures notified to the Commission, Spain does not have such rules in place. The Commission launched the infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice to the Spanish authorities in September 2022, followed by a reasoned opinion in June 2023. In February 2025, Spain notified to the Commission national measures transposing some, but not all, of the provisions of the Directive into their national law. The Commission considers that efforts by the authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Spain to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial sanctions.

In 2024, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) recommended the recovery of more than €870 million in misused EU funds, according to its annual report released today. OLAF investigators also prevented over €40 million from being improperly spent, reinforcing OLAF’s role as guardian of the EU budget. Over the year, OLAF closed 246 investigations and issued 301 recommendations to national and EU authorities, while opening 230 new investigations. This report marks not only a strong year of operations, but also OLAF’s 25thanniversary – underscoring a quarter-century of dedicated service in protecting the EU’s financial interests and reaffirming OLAF’s leading role in the fight against fraud. Key figures in 2024:\n",

      "OLAF opened230 new investigations, following 1138 preliminary analyses carried out by OLAF experts. From complex financial fraud and cross-border illicit trade to customs violations, environmental fraud, and the prevention of sanctions evasion, OLAF has consistently demonstrated its relevance and adaptability in the face of evolving challenges.In the last three years, OLAF investigations have led to the recovery of €4.5 billion and the prevention of more than €800 million in irregular spending— clear evidence of its crucial role in safeguarding the EU’s financial interests. “In 2024, we continued to fight fraud on all fronts,”said OLAF Director-General Ville Itälä.“Whether it’s protecting EU investment in local communities, safeguarding health through action against counterfeit goods or ensuring that the EU funds are used properly and continue to serve its purpose – OLAF is here to detect, act and safeguard”. “We remain committed to our purpose: to ensure fairness and protect EU citizens, businesses, and communities. The closer we collaborate, the better outcomes we achieve, more effectively safeguarding taxpayers’ money and deterring potential fraudsters”, he continued. “It’s incredibly fulfilling to know that our investigations have helped protect people’s health, kept dangerous products off the market, preserved the environment, and strengthened trust in the EU institutions. That’s what drives us every day.”\n",

In one particular Member State, OLAF uncovered a corruption network and ensured that the necessary measures were taken to recover €75 million EU funds meant to finance 112 projects aimed at improving citizens’ lives and a challenged economy.

These decisions, covering various EU policy areas, aim to ensure the proper application of EU law for the benefit of citizens and businesses. The key decisions taken by the Commission are presented below and grouped by policy area. The Commission is also closing 112 cases where the issues with the Member States concerned have been solved. In these cases, the Commission does not have to pursue the infringement procedure further. The Commission's enforcement activities and Member States' compliance with EU law can be followed throughinteractive maps and customisable graphs. For more details on the history of a case or to access the full database of infringement decisions, theinfringement decisions' registeris open for consultation. And more information on the EU infringement procedure can be found in the followingQ&A. (For more information: Maciej Berestecki – Tel. :+32 2 296 64 83; Maëlys Dreux – Tel. : +32 229 54673) Letters of formal notice Commission calls on BULGARIA, GREECE, SPAIN, the NETHERLANDS and PORTUGAL to correctly transpose the Drinking Water DirectiveThe European Commission decided to open infringement procedures by sending letters of formal notice toBulgaria(INFR(2025)2030),Greece(INFR(2025)2049),Spain(INFR(2025)2026), theNetherlands(INFR(2025)2048) andPortugal(INFR(2025)2068) for failing to correctly transpose the recast Drinking Water Directive (Directive (EU) 2020/2184), which contributes to improving water resilience across the EU and achieving theEU's zero pollution ambition.

According to the Commission, French rules fail to comply with theServices Directive 2006/123/ECand with Articles 49 and 56 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, which ensure that service providers do not face unjustified barriers when establishing themselves in a Member State or providing services cross-border. The French rules require that a majority of shareholders in a veterinary company be exercising veterinarians within the company in question. The French rules also require veterinarians to be present in each of their establishments at least part-time. This limits the number of veterinary companies a veterinarian can work in.',\n",

On the contrary, Hungary has consistently prolonged this tax measure without indicating a clear timeline for expiry so far, and has, over time, increased the highest tax rates applicable under the retail tax regime.

The recast Drinking Water Directive further protects human health by updating water quality standards, tackling pollutants of concern, such as endocrine disruptors and microplastics, and providing cleaner tap water. The Directive also tackles water leakages when now, on average,30%of thedrinkingwater is lost during distribution in the EU. Member States were required to transpose the Directive into national law and comply with its provisions by 12 January 2023. In Bulgaria, national law does not correctly reflect the scope of exemptions and derogations provided in the Directive, the risk assessment and risk management required for the drinking water supply system, and aspects regarding the monitoring of the quality of drinking water. Concerning Greece, national law reduces the scope of application of the Directive and does not include all drinking water suppliers. For Spain, shortcomings include reducing the scope of application of the Directive, the lack of specific provisions on risk assessments regarding the drinking water supply system, and no provisions for a periodic review. The Dutch legislation has shortcomings as regards monitoring the quality of drinking water and promoting access to drinking water. The Portuguese legislation fails to correctly transpose several provisions of the Directive. This includes those related to the scope of application, the extent of the risk assessment regarding the drinking water supply system, the role of the competent authorities, and the products allowed to be in contact with drinking water. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of satisfactory responses, the Commission may decide to issue reasoned opinions. Commission calls on LITHUANIA to ensure periodic review of water permitsThe Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toLithuania(INFR(2025)2028) for failing to correctly transpose the Water Framework Directive(Directive 2000/60/EC), including the obligation to carry out periodic reviews of water permits. Full implementation of EU water quality standards is key to protecting human health and the environment. The Directive requires Member States to establish a programme of measures for each river basin district to ensure good status of European water bodies, such as rivers and lakes. Each programme must include measures to control different types of water abstraction, impoundment, point source discharge, diffuse pollution sources, etcetera. Member States are required to periodically review and update these control measures, including any permits granted, to determine whether they still achieve their objectives. However, in Lithuania, the obligation to periodically review water abstractions is incorrectly transposed both for surface water and groundwater. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Lithuania, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on GERMANY to correctly transpose the Waste Framework DirectiveThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toGermany(INFR(2025)2047) for failing to correctly transpose the Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/ECas amended byDirective 2018/851/EU). The amended Directive sets legally binding targets for preparing for re-use and recycling of certain waste streams, including municipal waste. It also requires Member States to improve their waste management systems and resource efficiency. Member States were required to transpose the amended Directive into national law by 5 July 2020. The Commission has found that Germany has not correctly transposed the requirements for Extended Producer Responsibility Schemes (in terms of geographical coverage and adequate self-control and monitoring mechanisms), the duty to collect waste separately and separate unlawfully mixed waste, the rules on selective demolition, and rules on the use of materials produced from bio-waste. Germany also failed to encourage home composting. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Germany, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on SPAIN to correctly transpose the Seveso III DirectiveThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toSpain(INFR(2025)2029) for failing to correctly transpose the Seveso III Directive\\xa0(Directive 2012/18/EU) on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances. The Directive applies to over 12,000 industrial installations across the EU and provides the relevant framework on risk management measures to prevent major accidents and to limit their consequences. It plays a\\xa0key role in steering the EU towards zero pollution from industrial accidents, a commitment set out in theZero Pollution Action Plan. The Commission found that Spain has not correctly transposed several provisions of the Seveso III Directive. This includes provisions on reporting obligations; time limits to draw up emergency plans for new establishments; and the need to clean up the environment following a major accident. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Spain, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on POLAND to bring its national legislation in line with the Single Use Plastic DirectiveThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toPoland(INFR(2025)2046) for failing to correctly transpose the provisions of the Single-Use Plastics Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/904). The Directive aims to prevent and reduce the impact of certain plastic products on the environment and on human health, as well as to promote the transition to acircular economy. In Polish legislation, the definition of the ‘producer' does not cover all activities carried out by entities producing and introducing single-use plastic products on the market. Therefore, the scope of the application of the rules on single-use plastic is limited. Polish legislation also does not guarantee that all waste management costs of the single-use plastic products under the Extended Producer Responsibility schemes are properly calculated and borne by waste producers. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Poland, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Additional letter of formal notice under Article 258 TFUE Commission calls on SLOVAKIA to bring national laws in line with the Environmental Impact Assessment DirectiveThe European Commission decided to send an additional letter of formal notice toSlovakia(INFR(2019)2223) for failing to bring national law in line with the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive (Directive 2011/92/EUas amended byDirective 2014/52/EU). The Directive requires major building or development projects in the EU to be assessed for their impact on the environment before the project can start. Slovakia has not correctly transposed all the requirements of the EIA Directive into national law. The shortcomings are related mainly to the timeliness of the decisions, to possible conflicts of interest, as well as to the lack of effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. In October 2019, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Slovakia, which agreed to address the identified shortcomings. Since then, the amendment to the Slovak EIA Act entered into force on 1 January 2025, followed by the entry into force of the new Slovak Construction Act on 15 March 2025. However, despite these efforts to address the shortcomings, the current legislative framework in Slovakia still does not fully comply with the EIA Directive, especially regarding access to justice. The Commission is therefore sending an additional letter of formal notice to Slovakia, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Reasoned opinions Commission calls on BULGARIA, GREECE, HUNGARY, and SLOVAKIA to comply with the reporting obligations under the Noise DirectiveToday, the European Commission decided to send reasoned opinions toBulgaria(INFR(2024)2203),Greece(INFR(2024)2198),Hungary(INFR(2024)2199) andSlovakia(INFR(2024)2202) for failing to comply with the Noise Directive (Directive 2002/49/EC). The Noise Directive identifies noise pollution levels and triggers the necessary action as a response, such as appropriate urban planning and noise protection measures. The Directive requires Member States to adopt maps showing noise exposure within major agglomerations, along main railway lines, main roads and around major airports. These strategic noise maps serve as a basis for defining measures to help reduce noise pollution in the noise action plans. Member States are also required to inform the Commission of the findings of the strategic noise maps so that it can draw up a report covering the situation of noise exposure in the EU. The Commission sent letters of formal notice to these four Member States in October 2024. Since then, these four Member States have failed to report all relevant information on the strategic noise maps, including noise exposure of the population to the Commission. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary and Slovakia, which now have two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Commission calls on ITALY to prevent and manage the spread of invasive alien speciesToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toItaly(INFR(2024)2226) for failing to prevent and manage the introduction and spread of the fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), as required by the Invasive Alien Species Regulation (IASRegulation (EU) 1143/2014). Invasive alien species are one of the five major causes of biodiversity loss in Europe and worldwide. The IAS Regulation aims to prevent, minimise and mitigate the adverse effects of invasive alien species on biodiversity and related ecosystems, as well as on human health and safety, and to reduce their social and economic impact in Europe. Contrary to the Regulation, after the documentation of the fire ant in Sicily, Italy did not notify without delay the Commission and the other Member States of its early detection. The Italian authorities also did not notify the Commission of the eradication measures taken within three months of the early detection notification. The Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Italy in November 2024. It appears that no eradication measure was taken for a long time after the detection of the fire ant and that Italy did not take all the necessary measures to prevent the unintentional spread of the fire ant. Italy has also not effectively implemented the surveillance system of invasive alien species of Union concern. Moreover, Italy has not addressed several arguments raised in the letter of formal notice. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Italy, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Commission calls on ROMANIA to take the necessary steps to protect and manage its Natura 2000 sitesToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toRomania(INFR(2020)2238) for failing to comply with the Habitats Directive (Directive 92/43/EEC). Under the Habitats Directive, Member States must propose sites of Community importance, which will become part of the EU-wideNatura 2000network. After a site has been endorsed by the Commission, the Member State has six years to designate it as a Special Area of Conservation and to establish conservation objectives and measures that will maintain or restore the protected species and habitats to a favourable conservation status. These are key requirements to manage the Natura 2000 network and to protect biodiversity across the EU. On 2 July 2020, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Romania for failing to designate 382 sites of Community importance as Special Areas of Conservation. The Commission also found that Romania failed to set site-specific detailed conservation objectives for these sites. Since then, Romania has designated 213 Special Areas of Conservation, while 169 sites remain undesignated. Additionally, 16 sites do not have site-specific conservation objectives, and 208 sites have incomplete site-specific conservation objectives. Also, the conservation measures for 10 sites are too general to ensure an adequate protection of the habitats and species for which these have been designated. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Romania, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Commission calls on SLOVAKIA to improve its treatment of wasteToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toSlovakia(INFR(2021)2168) for failing to correctly apply the Landfill Directive (Directive 1999/31/EC) and the Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/ECas amended byDirective(EU)2018/851). The Landfill Directive sets standards for landfills to prevent adverse effects on human health, water, soil and air. Under this Directive, Member States must take measures to ensure that only waste that has been subject to treatment is landfilled. Under the Waste Framework Directive, Member States must recover and dispose of waste in a manner that does not endanger human health and the environment. It prohibits the abandonment, dumping or uncontrolled disposal of waste. In November 2021, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Slovakia. However, the identified shortcomings have not yet been remedied. Firstly, Slovakia still has not transposed correctly into its national legislation the obligation to pre-treat waste before landfilling, and repeatedly postponed the entry into force of this obligation – currently until 1 January 2027. In addition, Slovakia has not yet taken all the planned measures to support separate collection, such as increase of landfilling fees and an introduction of the ‘pay as you throw' principle. Despite improvement, the level of separate collection of municipal waste is thus still low in Slovakia. Furthermore, the capacity of installations for treatment of waste before landfilling is still insufficient. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Slovakia, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Referrals to the Court of Justice Commission decides to refer POLAND to the Court of Justice of the European Union for not transposing the Drinking Water DirectiveToday, the European Commission decided to referPoland(INFR(2023)0089)to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to adopt national laws transposing the recast Drinking Water Directive (Directive (EU) 2020/2184). The recast Drinking Water Directive further protects human health by updating water quality standards, tackling pollutants of concern, such as endocrine disruptors and microplastics, and providing cleaner tap water. The recast Directive also tackles water leakages when now, on average, 30% of the drinking water is lost during distribution in the EU. Member States were required to transpose the Directive into national law and comply with its provisions by 12 January 2023. The Commission considers that efforts by the Polish authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Poland to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial sanctions. More information is in thepress release. Commission decides to refer GREECE to the Court of Justice of the European Union for not adopting noise action plansToday, the European Commission decided to referGreece(INFR(2017)2150) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to adopt noise action plans for all agglomerations and major roads as required under the Noise Directive (Directive 2002/49/EC). The Noise Directive identifies noise pollution levels and triggers the necessary action as a response, such as appropriate urban planning and noise protection measures. The Directive requires Member States to adopt maps showing noise exposure within major agglomerations, along main railway lines, main roads and around major airports. These strategic noise maps serve as a basis for defining measures to help reduce noise pollution in the noise action plans. They are key for informing the public about the levels of noise they are exposed to, so that they can verify themselves whether their authorities take sufficient action. Noise maps had not been adopted for most agglomerations and those that were adopted did not meet the minimum requirements set by the Directive and the public had not been properly consulted. Greece had also failed to properly identify all roads for which strategic maps and action plans should have been prepared. Despite some progress, several grievances remained. The Commission considers that efforts by the Greek authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Greece to the Court of Justice of the European Union. More information is in thepress release. Commission decides to refer POLAND to the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning access to justice in environmental casesToday, the European Commission decided to referPoland(INFR(2020)2105) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to ensure that members of the public concerned, including individuals and environmental NGOs, can challenge the absence or insufficiency of air quality plans, required under the Ambient Air Quality Directive (Directive 2008/50/EC). When the limit values for air pollution set by EU law are exceeded, the Directive requires Member States to adopt air quality plans and set appropriate measures to keep exceedance periods as short as possible. In parallel, under the Aarhus Convention and the EU Treaties, individual citizens and environmental NGOs must be able to challenge authorities' decisions or lack thereof if they believe the action taken is insufficient. The Commission considers that the efforts made by the Polish authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Poland to the Court of Justice of the European Union. More information is in thepress release. Letter of formal notice post-judgment (Article 260 TFEU) Commission calls on GREECE to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice to protect natural habitats and speciesThe European Commission decided to send a letter of formal notice under Article 260 TFEU toGreece(INFR(2014)2260) for failing to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 17 December 2020 (C‑849/19). The ruling found that Greece has not established conservation objectives and measures for 239 Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) as required by the Habitats Directive (Directive 92/43/EEC). Under the Habitats Directive, Member States must propose sites of Community importance (SCIs), which will become part of the EU-wideNatura 2000network. After a site has been endorsed by the Commission, the Member State has six years to designate it as a SAC and to establish conservation objectives and measures that will maintain or restore the protected species and habitats to a favourable conservation status. These are key requirements to manage the Natura 2000 network and to protect biodiversity across the EU. While Greece has designated 239 SACs and made progress in establishing conservation objectives since the Court ruling, it still has failed to establish the necessary conservation measures for all 239 SACs. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Greece, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to refer Greece to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial sanctions. (For more information: Maciej Berestecki - Tel.:+32 2 296 64 83, Anna Wartberger – Tel.: +32 2 298 20 54) Letter of formal notice Commission calls on PORTUGAL to effectively enforce rules against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishingThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toPortugal(INFR(2025)2072) for failing to properly enforce the EU's rules against illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. In its letter of formal notice, the Commission refers to structural shortcomings in Portugal's application of the EU Catch Certification Scheme (Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008), which is designed to prevent IUU-caught fish from entering the EU market. Despite the EU's zero-tolerance policy towards IUU fishing, which harms fish stocks, marine habitats, and coastal communities, Portugal has consistently failed to verify the origin of fishery products from third countries, allowing large quantities of high-value IUU-caught fish to enter the EU. Therefore, the Commission is sending a letter of formal notice to Portugal, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. (For more information: Lea Zuber – Tel.: +32 2 295 62 98; Federica Miccoli – Tel.: +32 229-58300) Letters of formal notice Commission calls on HUNGARY to comply with rules on freedom of establishmentThe European Commission has decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toHungary(INFR(2025)2051) for failing to award a high-value exploitation contract for sand and gravel mining sites in an open and transparent tender procedure. The freedom of establishment enshrined inArticle 49 TFEUrequires that public authorities ensure the equal treatment of economic operators and the transparency of award procedures. The Commission considers that Hungary failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 49 TFEU by awarding the exploitation contract in a closed tender procedure. The lack of transparency of this procedure precluded interested economic operators from participating in it. The contract has been awarded for a period of 20 years and extendable to 30 years, during which a continuous violation of the rights of other interested operators excluded from the award process is occurring. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Hungary, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on SLOVENIA to comply with public procurement rulesThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toSlovenia(INFR(2025)4011) for failing to comply with European public procurement rules.Directive 2014/24/EUon public procurement establishes the procedures for award of public contracts by Member States' authorities. The Directive provides for a few exceptions where national authorities are not required to follow these procedures.An amendment of the Slovenian Pharmacy Act exempts public pharmacy institutes from carrying out public procurement procedures for the purchase of medicines. The Commission considers that this exemption contravenes the obligations of the Directive. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Slovenia, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on HUNGARY to ensure equal treatment of economic operators for food and non-food productsThe European Commission decided to open infringement procedures by sending two letters of formal notice toHungary(INFR(2025)2052 and INFR(2025)2102) for imposing price margin restrictions on non-Hungarian companies. The first procedure concerns restrictions on the sale of certain food products by food retailers. The second procedure covers similar restrictions for the sale of certain non-food products by drugstores. The freedom of establishment pursuant toArticle 49 TFEUrequires public authorities to ensure the equal treatment and non-discrimination of economic operators and to refrain from restricting economic activities unless such restrictions are justified to attain certain public interest considerations. Hungary limits the margin between purchase prices and sales prices of certain products to a level that no longer covers the costs of foreign companies beyond their costs for purchasing products, forcing non-Hungarian retailers to sell their products at a loss. The Commission is therefore sending two letters of formal notice to Hungary, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue reasoned opinions. Reasoned opinions Commission asks FRANCE to comply with EU rules on freedom of movement for veterinary companies and veterinariansToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toFrance(INFR(2024)4005) regarding its national rules concerning veterinary companies and veterinarians. According to the Commission, French rules fail to comply with theServices Directive 2006/123/ECand with Articles 49 and 56 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, which ensure that service providers do not face unjustified barriers when establishing themselves in a Member State or providing services cross-border. The French rules require that a majority of shareholders in a veterinary company be exercising veterinarians within the company in question. The French rules also require veterinarians to be present in each of their establishments at least part-time. This limits the number of veterinary companies a veterinarian can work in. In addition, while French law allows, in principle, for the free provision of services, the practice restricts veterinarians established in other Member States from offering their services on a temporary and occasional basis in France. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to France, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Referrals to the Court of Justice Commission refers GERMANY to the Court of Justice of the European Union for incorrect transposition of the EU public procurement directivesToday, the European Commission has decided to referGermany(INFR(2018)2272) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for incorrect transposition of the EU public procurement Directives (Directive 2014/24/EUandDirective 2014/23/EU). The EU public procurement Directives contain provisions on postal services which have not been transposed into German law. In particular, German law does not require contracting entities to apply public procurement rules in this sector. First, the Commission considers that German law does not require from contracting authorities that they provide detailed information to tenderers after the conclusion of the contract to trigger the start of the shortened period for access to review. This makes it difficult for bidders to decide whether and by when to launch a review. Secondly, the definition of ‘contracting entity' in German law lacks clarity, complicating the selection of the appropriate tendering procedures. Thirdly, German law does not require contracting entities in the postal sector to apply public procurement rules. Despite some of the identified grievances having been resolved, the Commission considers that efforts by the authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Germany to the Court of Justice of the European Union. More information is in thepress release. Letter of formal notice post-judgment (Article 260 TFEU) Commission calls on PORTUGAL and SLOVAKIA to comply with the Late Payment DirectiveThe European Commission has decided to send two letters of formal notice under Article 260 TFEU toPortugalandSlovakia(INFR(2017)2037 and INFR(2016)4131) for failing to comply with their obligations under the Late Payment Directive (Directive 2011/7/EC), as confirmed by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Late payments negatively impact businesses by reducing liquidity, hindering growth, and weakening resilience. They also limit a business's ability to transition to greener practices and embrace digital transformation. Businesses and especially SMEs rely on regular payments to operate and pay their employees. The Late Payment Directive obliges public authorities to pay their invoices within 30 days (60 days for authorities providing healthcare). The Court of Justice found that Portugal and Slovakia have failed to fulfil their obligations under the Late Payments Directive (Commission v Portugal, 11 July 2024 and Commission v Slovakia, 19 September 2024). The measures announced by Portugal and Slovakia since the rulings have not delivered sufficient improvements in addressing the issue. Portugal and Slovakia now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may refer the cases back to the Court of Justice, with a request to impose financial sanctions.

Finland has also failed to correctly transpose certain provisions ofCommission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/68on marking and ofCommission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/69on alarm and signal weapons. The Firearms Directive sets common minimum standards on the acquisition, possession, and commercial exchange of civilian firearms, for example firearms used for sport shooting and hunting. The rules under the Directive allow for the lawful use and movement of firearms, essential components and ammunition for civilian use within the EU. At the same time, the Directive keeps high standards of security and protection against criminal acts and illicit trafficking of firearms.Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/68sets rules on the marking of firearms to increase the traceability of firearms and facilitate the safe transfer of firearms and essential components.Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/69sets technical specifications for alarm and signal weapons (which only discharge blank ammunition or irritants) to avoid that they are illegally converted into lethal firearms. The Commission is sending a letter of formal notice to Finland and Italy, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue reasoned opinions. Commission calls on IRELAND to fulfil the obligations on the marketing and use of explosives precursorsThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toIreland(INFR(2025)2053) for failing to comply with certain obligations under the Regulation on the marketing and use of explosives precursors (Regulation (EU) 2019/1148). The Regulation establishes EU-wide rules regarding substances and mixtures that could be misused to make homemade explosives. It limits the availability of those substances or mixtures to the general public and requires any suspicious transactions involving the substances to be reported to the appropriate authorities. The Commission considers that Ireland failed to comply with a number of obligations under the Regulation, such as the obligations to lay down rules on penalties, designate the competent authority for the implementation of the Regulation or notify measures for the licencing regime. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Ireland, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Reasoned opinions Commission calls on LUXEMBOURG, HUNGARY and SLOVAKIA to correctly transpose the provisions of the Child Sexual Abuse DirectiveToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toLuxembourg(INFR(2019)2236),Hungary(INFR(2019)2234) andSlovakia(INFR(2019)2135) for failure to correctly transpose into national law the Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography (Directive 2011/93/EU).The EU has strict rules criminalising child sexual abuse, child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse material across Europe. The Directive includes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions andintroduces provisions to strengthen the prevention of those crimes and the protection of child victims. The Directive also requires Member States to ensure that effective intervention programmes or measures are made available to offenders. The three Member States have not correctly transposed a number of these rules. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to these Member States, which now have two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Referrals to the Court of Justice Commission refers BULGARIA, IRELAND and PORTUGAL to the Court of Justice of the European Union for not complying with the Terrorist Content Online RegulationToday, the Commission decided to referBulgaria(INFR(2022)2113),Ireland(INFR(2022)2121) andPortugal(INFR(2022)2129)to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to comply with certain obligations from the Regulation on the dissemination of terrorist content online (“TCO Regulation” -Regulation (EU) 2021/784). The TCO Regulation, which became applicable on 7 June 2022, requires that terrorist content in the EU is taken down by online platforms within one hour upon receipt of a removal order issued by Member States' authorities. This helps to counter the spread of extremist ideologies online – which is key for preventing attacks and addressing radicalisation – while safeguarding fundamental rights. The Commission considers that Bulgaria, Ireland and Portugal have failed to comply with one or more obligations under the TCO Regulation. This includes the requirement to designate the authority or authorities responsible for enforcing the Regulation and ensuring compliance, and to notify the Commission of those authorities; to establish a public contact point to handle requests for clarification and feedback in relation to removal orders; and to lay down the rules and measures on penalties in case of non-compliance of hosting service providers with their legal obligations. The Commission is therefore referring Bulgaria, Ireland and Portugal to the Court of Justice of the European Union. More information is available in thepress release. (For more information:Markus Lammert – Tel.: +32 2 296 75 33; Yuliya Matsyk - Tel.: +32 2 226 27 16) Letters of formal notice The Commission calls on ITALY and LITHUANIA to correctly transpose the EU rules on the presumption of innocence and the right to be present at trial in criminal proceedingsThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toItaly(INFR(2025)2066) andLithuania(INFR(2025)2067), for failing to correctly transpose the Directive on the strengthening of the presumption of innocence and the right to be present at the trial in criminal proceedings (Directive 2016/343/EU). The Directive is one ofsix Directivesadopted by the EU to create common minimum standards ensuring that fair trialrights of suspects and accused personsin criminal proceedings are sufficiently protected across the EU. The Commission considers that certain national transposition measures notified by the two Member States fall short of the requirements of the Directive. In particular, the Commission found that Italy failed to correctly transpose the provisions on the limitations to the use of measures of physical restraint in public, the right to silence and not to incriminate oneself, whenever investigating authorities gather information at the scene or immediately after the offence and whenever the suspect gives spontaneous statements. Lithuania failed to transpose the measures related to public references to guilt, the use of measures of physical restraint in court, the temporary nature of the exclusion from the trial, and the right to a new trial. Moreover, both Member States have failed to correctly transpose the requirement to have the person triedin absentiainformed of their right to a new trial, as well as remedies available in case of breaches of the rights enshrined in the Directive. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Italy and Lithuania, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on MALTA to comply with EU rules on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial mattersThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toMalta(INFR(2025)2100), for failing to comply with its obligations under the Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments(Regulation (EU) 1215/2012)in the area of gambling. The Commission found that Malta failed to comply with the Regulation by imposing on its courts an obligation to systematically refuse —on grounds of national public policy— the recognition and enforcement of judgments issued by courts of other EU Member States against Maltese-licensed gaming companies. Additionally, Malta discourages foreign litigants from pursuing legal action in Maltese courts against these entities, despite EU rules designating such courts as the appropriate forum based on the defendant's domicile. The Commission considers that the Maltese legislation, by effectively shielding the online gaming sector from cross-border litigation, undermines the principle of mutual trust in the administration of justice within the Union. It also violates the prohibition on reviewing judgments from other Member States on their substance, exceeds the limits of the public policy exception, and distorts the EU's rules on jurisdiction. Therefore, the Commission is sending a letter of formal notice to Malta, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Reasoned opinions Commission calls on the NETHERLANDS to fully transpose the Directive on procedural safeguards for children in criminal proceedingsThe European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion totheNetherlands(INFR(2023)2089) for failing to fully transpose the Directive on procedural safeguards for children in criminal proceedings (Directive (EU) 2016/800) into national law. This Directive aims to guarantee common minimum standards regarding the rights of children who aresuspects or accused personsin criminal proceedings to ensure their right to a fair trial across the EU. The Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the Netherlands in October 2023. After analysing their reply, the Commission concluded that the Netherlands still failed to correctly transpose the provisions related to the right of the child to receive information on the requirement for the holder(s) of parental responsibility to be informed of the child's rights. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to the Netherlands, which now have two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Commission calls on GERMANY, LUXEMBOURG, and POLAND to transpose EU rules on the EU Emergency Travel DocumentToday, the European Commission decided to send reasoned opinions toGermany(INFR(2025)0028 and INFR(2025)0032),Luxembourg(INFR(2025)0067 and INFR(2025)0071) andPoland(INFR(2025)0084 and INFR(2025)0089) for failing to transposeCouncil Directive (EU) 2019/997establishing a uniform EU Emergency Travel Document (‘EU ETD') and the accompanyingCommission Delegated Directive (EU) 2024/1986. The EU ETD Directive provides that Member States issue EU Emergency Travel Documents to EU citizens whose passports have been lost, stolen, or destroyed when being abroad, to allow them to return to their countries of origin or residence. Member States had until 9 December 2024 to transpose both Directives into national law and must start issuing the new EU Emergency Travel Document on 9 December 2025. The Commission sent letters of formal notice to Germany, Luxembourg and Poland on 31 January 2025 for failing to communicate transposition measures. Since these Member States did not take the necessary measures to ensure the transposition of the two Directives, the Commission has decided to issue reasoned opinions to Germany, Luxembourg, and Poland. The three Member States now have two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Referrals to the Court of Justice Commission decides to refer POLAND and SWEDEN to the Court of Justice of the European Union for incorrectly transposing rules on the European arrest warrantToday, the European Commission decided to referPoland(INFR(2020)2308) andSweden(INFR(2020)2362) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to comply with the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA). The Commission sent a first letter of formal notice to Sweden in February 2021 and an additional letter of formal notice in February 2024 for failing to correctly transpose the provisions of the Framework Decision. However, the Commission still considered that the transposition by Sweden was not correct and therefore sent a reasoned opinion in October 2024. The Commission sent a first letter of formal notice to Poland in December 2020. After assessing the reply, the Commission considered that some of the grievances persisted and, therefore, sent an additional letter of formal notice to Poland in July 2023 and a reasoned opinion in April 2024. The Commission considers that efforts by the authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is thus referring Poland and Sweden to the Court of Justice of the European Union. More information is available in thepress release.

Member States are responsible for ensuring effective surveillance of their markets and that only products complying with all the applicable EU rules are placed on the market. In practical terms, this means checking products satisfy the minimum energy use requirements and have a correct energy label providing consumers with the information they need for purchase decisions. The Market Surveillance Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2019/1020) sets out the obligation of the Member States to ensure effective market surveillance, which include having a national market surveillance authority, resourcing it adequately and giving it power to investigate, performing checks on products at an adequate scale and reporting those checks in the Information and Communication System for Market Surveillance database. The Commission considers that the two Member States do not comply with this obligation and is therefore sending letters of formal notice to Portugal and Romania, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Commission calls on HUNGARY to abolish charges imposed on operators receiving free allowances under the EU Emissions Trading SystemToday, the European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toHungary(INFR(2025)4016), for applying a carbon quota tax and a transaction fee to recipients of a significant free allocation of allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS,Directive 2003/87/EC), as those charges interfere with the EU law. The ETS Directive andCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331lay down harmonised rules on the free allocation of allowances to industrial installations participating in the EU ETS. Free allocation refers to the distribution of emissions allowances at no cost to certain installations, to help prevent “carbon-leakage”, meaning the relocation of industries outside the EU to countries with less stringent climate policies. These free allowances must be granted without charges or conditions that would undermine their intended economic benefit. Furthermore, the EU ETS Registry Regulation (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/1122) requires any fees charged by national competent authorities on holders of the accounts in theUnion Registryto be reasonable. By contrast, Hungarian legislation provides for charges which apply to recipients of significant free allocation, and they are qualified as such according to the amount of annual emissions and of received free allocation. The first charge is the carbon quota tax, equivalent to €36 per tonne of CO2yearly emissions of the installation. The second charge is a transaction fee, payable to the competent authority after a transfer of allowances under the EU ETS, whether allocated for free or purchased. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Hungary, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Reasoned opinions Commission urges GREECE and FINLAND to fully transpose EU rules accelerating permitting procedures for renewable energy projectsToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toGreece(INFR(2024)0221) andFinland(INFR(2024)0226) for failing to fully transpose into national law the provisions of the revised Renewable Energy Directive related to the simplification and acceleration of permitting procedures. The revised Directive (Directive (EU) 2023/2413, amendingDirective (EU) 2018/2001entered into force in November 2023 and certain provisions had to be transposed into national law by 1 July 2024. These provisions include measures to simplify and accelerate permitting procedures both for renewable energy projects and for the infrastructure projects which are necessary to integrate the additional capacity into the electricity system. They also include clear time limits for permit-granting procedures targeted to specific technologies or types of projects, the strengthening of the role of the single contact point for applications and the presumption that renewable energy projects and the related grid infrastructure are of overriding public interest. In September 2024, the Commission sent letters of formal notice to 26 Member States for failing to fully transpose the Directive into national law. After having examined the transposition measures notified by Greece and Finland, the Commission has concluded that neither of the two Member States have yet fully transposed the provisions related to the simplification and acceleration of permitting procedures. The Commission is therefore sending a reasoned opinion to both Member States, which now have two months to respond and take the necessary measures to complete the transposition. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union. (For more information:Anna-Kaisa Itkonen – Tel.: +32 2 295 75 01;Saul Louis Goulding – Tel.: +32 229-64735) Letters of formal notice Commission calls on BELGIUM and PORTUGAL to deploy customs electronic systemsThe European Commission decided to open infringement procedures by sending letters of formal notice to Portugal (INFR(2025 2064) andBelgium(INFR(2025)2016) for failing to deploy the system for Temporary Storage for air transport and – in the case ofPortugal(INFR(2025) 2064) - in addition for also failing to deploy the National Import System . The Member States were obliged to build and make these systems operational, including by ensuring full migration of the relevant economic operators' systems, by 31 December 2023 according to the Union Customs Code (Regulation (EU) 952/2013) and the UCC Work Programme (Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2023/2879). The electronic system for temporary storage allows the relevant declarations to be lodged electronically and is one of the crucial steps to ensure the supervision of goods entering the EU. Once these declarations are launched electronically, the National Import System ensures that relevant measures of both a fiscal and non-fiscal nature are applied to goods imported into the EU. By providing interconnections with various other national applications, the National Import System plays a central role in ensuring, among others, the effective collection of revenues and the protection of the EU's financial interests, as well as the enforcement of EU level and national prohibitions/restrictions in connection with the import of goods. The Commission is therefore sending letters of formal notice to Belgium and Portugal, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion Commission calls on BELGIUM to comply with EU customs data transmission requirementsThe European Commission decided to open infringement procedures by sending letter of formal notice to Belgium (INFR(2025)2009) for failing to meet their obligations on customs data transmission. Under the Union Customs Code (UCC) (Regulation (EU) 952/2013) and theCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447, the Member States are required to transmit specific customs data through SURV3, an EU-operated digital system accessible to national customs authorities. The SURV3 IT system ensures the collection and monitoring of customs data across the European Union, facilitating the uniform application of customs controls, effective risk management, and compliance with EU border measures. The UCC and the UCC-IA stipulate that Member States must transmit a set of 57 standardised data elements in a specified format to the SURV3 system. However, despite deadlines to comply, the targeted Member States continue to use outdated formats and provide reduced datasets. This non-compliance undermines the efficacy and reliability of EU customs operations and the regulatory frameworks that support them. The Commission is therefore sending letter of formal notice to Belgium, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings identified by the Commission. In the absence of satisfactory responses, the Commission may decide to issue reasoned opinions. Commission calls on SPAIN to end the discriminatory taxation of non-resident individuals' dwellings used as habitual residenceThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice toSpain(INFR(2025)4007) for failing to align its rules on taxation of non-resident taxpayers on their dwellings used as habitual residence with the free movement of workers (Article 45 TFEUandArticle 28 EEA) and with the free movement of capital (Article 63 TFEUandArticle 40 EEA). While resident taxpayers are not subject to tax on deemed income attributable to their dwellings used as habitual residence, non-resident taxpayers are required to pay income tax on 2% of the cadastral value of their dwellings used as habitual residence as deemed income. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Spain, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings identified by the Commission. In the absence of satisfactory responses, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Reasoned opinion Commission calls on PORTUGAL to comply with the EU excise duty legislation on wineToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toPortugal(INFR(2020)4063) for failing to comply with EU excise duty rules on wine (Council Directive 92/83/EEC). EU excise duty legislation allows the application of a zero-excise duty on wine. Stronger wines (with an alcoholic strength between 15% and 18% by volume) may benefit from this treatment only if their strength has been obtained naturally. However, if the alcoholic strength of these products has been increased for example by the addition of sugar or alcohol, a higher excise duty rate must be charged. The Portuguese legislation does not include this condition. As a result, these products incorrectly benefit from the zero rate applicable in Portugal to wine. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Portugal, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Commission calls on HUNGARY to abolish its retail tax regime to comply with the freedom of establishmentThe European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion toHungary(INFR(2024)4022) for failing to bring its retail tax regime in line with the freedom of establishment guaranteed byArticles 49and54of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Due to the current design of the retail tax regime, foreign controlled retail companies operating in Hungary as integrated companies or linked undertakings, are subject to high and steeply progressive tax rates on their turnover. Domestic retailers operating on the Hungarian market under their respective brands and logos via franchise systems are not subject to the same highest rates because their turnover is not consolidated for taxation purposes. Notably, the regime prevents the foreign controlled retail companies from restructuring their business operations like those domestic retail companies. Therefore, the retail tax regime constitutes a restriction to the freedom of establishment. According to the 2023 and 2024 Country Specific Recommendations (CSR) to Hungary, this tax disproportionally burdens larger foreign companies, similarly to other sector-specific taxes introduced in the recent years and affecting the internal market. As part of its Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP), which was endorsed by the Council on 15 December 2022, Hungary committed to phase out the retail tax, which had been introduced in 2022 to increase the contribution of the retail sector to public finances. However, Hungary has so far failed to phase out the surtax on the retail sector. On the contrary, Hungary has consistently prolonged this tax measure without indicating a clear timeline for expiry so far, and has, over time, increased the highest tax rates applicable under the retail tax regime. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Hungary, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Referrals to the Court of Justice Commission decides to refer PORTUGAL to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to notify measures in the area of excise dutyToday, the European Commission decided to referPortugal(INFR(2022)0160 and INFR(2022)0162)to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to fully transpose into national lawCouncil Directive (EU) 2020/262of 19 December 2019 laying down the general arrangements for excise duty (recast) andCouncil Directive (EU) 2020/1151of 29 July 2020 amendingDirective 92/83/EECon the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic beverages. Directive (EU) 2020/262 is of crucial importance in the area of excise duty by providing common rules on the movements of excise goods. The remaining transposition gap in Portugal affects for instance the validity of the guarantees submitted by excise operators. Such guarantees are needed to perform cross border movements of excise goods within the EU. Directive (EU) 2020/1151 sets up an EU-wide certification system for small alcohol producers to facilitate their access to lower excise duty rates across the Union. It also supports the fight against fraud by clarifying the conditions for the application of the exemptions for alcohol not intended for human consumption. The transposition gap by Portugal affects the cross-border trade of alcohol produced by small producers of wine to other Member States and of the alcohol not intended for human consumption. All EU Member States were required to bring into force the laws necessary to fully transpose Directive (EU) 2020/262 and Directive (EU) 2020/1151 by 31 December 2021 and communicate the text of those measures to the Commission immediately. However, the national measures fully transposing these Directives still have not been notified by Portugal. The Commission considers that efforts by the authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Portugal to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial sanctions. More information is in thepress release.

The Directive sets common rules on imposing distance-based charges (tolls) and time-based user charges (vignette/s), allowing Member States to recover infrastructure costs (construction, operation, maintenance) through tolls or vignettes. Belgium did not communicate its transposition measures within the prescribed deadline of 25 March 2024. Despite receiving a letter of formal notice on 23 May 2024, Belgium has only partially complied with the transposition requirements, notifying measures for the Flanders and Brussels Capital regions, but not for the Wallonia region. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion. Belgium now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

The rules are related to the extended collective licensing system in place for the right of communication to the public of musical works. After sendinga first letter of formal noticecalling on Romania to bring its law in line with the EU copyright framework, Romania amended its legislation. The Commission found that the amendments did not fully address the infringement, and it sent Romania anadditional letter of formal notice. However, the Commission continues having concerns as regards the compatibility of the Romanian Copyright Act with EU Copyright law since the broad scope of the extended collective licensing system in Romanian law affects the exercise of the authors' exclusive right of communication to the public. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Romania, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

The Commission considers that French law does not ensure that workers, who fall ill during their annual leave, can take later their annual leave days that overlapped with their illness. The Commission considers that French law therefore does not comply with the Working Time Directive and does not ensure the health and safety of workers. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to France, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion. Referral to the Court of Justice Commission decides to refer SPAIN to the Court of Justice of the European Union for not fully transposing the rules on transparent and predictable working conditions into national lawToday, the European Commission decided to referSpain(INFR(2022)0354) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to fully transpose the Directive on transparent and predictable working conditions (Directive 2019/1152) into national law. EU rules require, for instance, that workers receive timely and complete information about essential aspects of their job, such as working time and remuneration. According to the measures notified to the Commission, Spain does not have such rules in place. The Commission launched the infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice to the Spanish authorities in September 2022, followed by a reasoned opinion in June 2023. In February 2025, Spain notified to the Commission national measures transposing some, but not all, of the provisions of the Directive into their national law. The Commission considers that efforts by the authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Spain to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial sanctions.

      "Today, I want to pay tribute to the more than 8,300  Bosniak boys and men who were killed and those who are still missing. As some of the last victims of Srebrenica are buried in dignity, I also honour the mothers, wives, and daughters who continue to grieve, carrying the weight of loss through three decades. It is our duty to remember and to preserve the truth, so that future generations know exactly what happened. They must know that in the Summer of 1995, victims were systematically executed and buried in mass graves within the UN-designated 'safe area' of Srebrenica. A town they believed would protect them in the brutal war that was ravaging Bosnia and Herzegovina. The European Union will never forget what happened in this town. We acknowledge our past and recognise our responsibility for failing to prevent and stop the genocide\n",
      "We will also never allow history to be rewritten. We firmly reject and condemn any denial, distortion, or minimisation of the Srebrenica genocide, as well as the glorification of war criminals. Political leaders have a great responsibility in that regard, in particular in Bosnia and Herzegovina and across the Western Balkans. They must lead by example in acknowledging the established facts and genuinely honouring the victims. And they must actively work towards reconciliation by confronting the roots of hatred that led to these atrocities. This is the only way towards a brighter and prosperous future for the next generation. Finally, I want to send a message to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina: the European Union stands with you. We remain fully committed to supporting your country on its path toward EU membership. Your political leaders should do their part so your country can find its place at the heart of our Union, where it belongs.\n"

The closer we collaborate, the better outcomes we achieve, more effectively safeguarding taxpayers’ money and deterring potential fraudsters”, he continued. “It’s incredibly fulfilling to know that our investigations have helped protect people’s health, kept dangerous products off the market, preserved the environment, and strengthened trust in the EU institutions.

With this latest payment, the Commission's total lending to Ukraine under this MFA reaches€7 billion since the beginning of 2025. As agreed by the European leaders in theSpecial European Councilin early March, and reiterated by President Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission stands ready to frontload the EU contribution to the ERA loans initiative, if necessary. It remains in close contact with the Ukrainian authorities concerning subsequent disbursements. Should Ukraine submit a request, the Commission is prepared to respond swiftly.

Pilot projects and international cooperation The EU is currently piloting nature credit initiatives in France, Estonia, and Peru and is working with international partners such as the Biodiversity Credit Alliance, the World Economic Forum and the International Advisory Panel on Biodiversity Credits. Nature credits can also support Member States in meeting national targets under the EU Nature Restoration Regulation and contribute to the global goals of the Kunming-Montreal Biodiversity Framework. Background Nature is a cornerstone of our livelihoods, health and prosperity and a crucial foundation for a competitive and resilient economy. According to the World Economic Forum, more than half of global GDP and two thirds of the EU's added economic value depend on nature and its ecosystem services. The aims of nature credits are also in line with theVision for Agriculture and Food, theWater Resilience Strategyand theEuropean Ocean Pact. For More Information Roadmap towards Nature Credits Questions and answers on nature credits With this roadmap, we are taking a bold step to recognise nature as a strategic asset for Europe’s future. Nature credits have the potential to attract essential private investment, while also rewarding those who are the custodians of our land and seas, including farmers, foresters and local communities. Our goal is clear: working hand in hand with nature and turning this into an opportunity for a resilient and competitive economy. We have to put nature on the balance sheet. That’s exactly what nature credits do. When well-designed, they will provide an efficient, market-driven instrument that encourage the private sector to invest and innovate. With investment and innovation, we generate revenue for those who work to protect nature, including our farmers, our landowners, our foresters.
